Google Apps Script for sending messages through a webhook on Discord. Original code is from: https://www.labnol.org/code/20563-post-message-to-discord-webhooks, but I corrected some problems with the code.

This repository was created to show you how to setup a webhook in Discord, then post messages with it using a Google Apps Script. Again, most of the code was taken from this article: https://www.labnol.org/code/20563-post-message-to-discord-webhooks, but there were some errors that I corrected.

## Creating the Webhook on Discord

To create a webhook in a server, right click on the server icon. Hover over Server Settings, then press Integerations.
